                </header>
                
<h3>Effective Date: 1 October 2018</h3>
<p>The following Privacy Policy describes the information KOAMTAC, Inc. (“KOAMTAC,” “we,” or “us”) collects from Account Holders and End Users (“you”) through the KOAMTACON websites and application (“service”). It also describes how we may use, share, and handle the information we collect.</p>
<p>Before using KOAMTACON you should review this Policy. By using this service, you are consenting to the collection, processing, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you are not authorized to, and you may not, access or use this service.</p> 
<p>KOAMTAC, Inc. reserves the right to revise this Policy at any time, in our discretion, and for any or no reason. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting such changes to the KOAMTACON website. By continuing to access and use KOAMTACON, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by any such revisions. Accordingly, you should periodically review this Policy. For your convenience, whenever this Policy is changed, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. We encourage you to check the Effective Date to see if this Policy have been revised since your last visit.</p>

<h3>What Information We Collect &amp; Control</h3>
<p>When you interact with the service, or otherwise use or visit the service, we may collect personal information, that is, information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. For example, we may collect your name, contact information, and business information. In certain instances, you may have the choice to provide such information. However, if you choose not to do so, it may impact our ability to provide you with certain services or assistance. You may also have the opportunity to opt into receiving communications from us. Where indicated just select the appropriate option. We may also collect non-personally identifiable information, including through the use of cookies.</p> 
<p><i>Information from your web browser or mobile device.</i>  You may generally visit most of the KOAMTACON website without telling us who you are or providing personal information.  We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device when you visit the site.  For example, we may collect your IP address, the name and type of your browser, and the date and time you visit, depending on your browser or device settings which you may be able to change.  While this information is not, on its own, personally identifiable, we may combine it with other information that does identify you.</p>
<p><i>Cookies and Other Technologies:</i>  A “cookie” is a small file placed on your device when you visit a site, such as ours.  A “session cookie” expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).  A “persistent cookie” stores information on the hard drive so that when you end your session and return to the same web site at a later date, the cookie information is still available.  We use cookies and other technologies to collect information to improve and support functions on the KOAMTACON website so we can serve you better.  For example, we may use these technologies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>collect information about how visitors access and use the website, such as which pages they visit and for how long, and what functions or links they use most often; and</li>
<li>support the features and functionality of the website, and make it more personal, for example, by repopulating information you have already provided so you do not need to enter that information again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with your browser, we do not collect personally identifiable information using cookies and other technologies, but we may link it to personal information that you provide or that we have.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.   However, you may, at any time, control the use of cookies by selecting your browser settings on your device.  You may also be able to receive an alert when a cookie is placed on your device.  If you choose to reject cookies when you access or use the service, it may impact your ability to use all of the features and functions.</p>
<p>In addition to the cookies we may deliver to your computer or device through the service, some of our third party partners may deliver cookies to you.  For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites.  To learn more about Google Analytics, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.  Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device in order to track your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites or to deliver targeted advertisements either on this Site or on other websites.  You have choices about the information third parties may collect about you through this Site.  For example, if you do not want your information sent to a third party, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you do not configure your browser or actively opt out, you will accept cookies provided by this Site.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>
<p>We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all KOAMTAC websites and products.</p>
<p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.</p>
<p>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Information that KOAMTAC processes on your behalf</h3>

This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor). The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.</p>
<p><i>Information from mobile devices</i> : When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device. Our applications require such access to provide their services. Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders. This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations. You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device. The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).</p>

<p>We recognize that you own your service data. We provide you complete control of your service data by providing you the ability to (i) access your service data, (ii) share your service data through supported third-party integrations, and (iii) request export or deletion of your service data.</p>
<p><u>How we use service data</u></p>
<p>We process your service data when you provide us instructions through the various modules of our services. For example, when you generate a rental summary, information such as the name and address of your customer will be used to generate the invoice; and when you use delivery app to control delivery of  packages, the addresses of the individuals receiving deliveries will be used for ensuring timely delivery.</p>
<p><u>Who we share service data with</u></p>
<p><i>KOAMTAC, Inc. and third party sub-processors</i>: In order to provide services and technical support for our products, the contracting entity within KOAMTAC, Inc. engages other group entities and third parties .</p>
<p><i>Employees and independent contractors</i>: We may provide access to your service data to our employees and individuals who are independent contractors involved in providing the services (collectively our “employees”) so that they can identify, analyze and resolve errors. We ensure that access by our employees to your service data is restricted to specific individuals, and is logged and audited. Our employees will also have access to data that you knowingly share with us for technical support or to import data into our products or services. We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within KOAMTAC, Inc.</p>
<p><i>Other cases</i>: Other scenarios in which we may share information that are common to information covered under Parts I and II are described in Part III.</p>
