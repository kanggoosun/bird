"Application(s) and Project(s)" means any and all applications and/or projects, generated, owned or possessed by CUSTOMER that are related to the CUSTOMER use of KOAMTCON.

Section 2.  Application Software Services
2.1 Scope.  Provided that CUSTOMER remains in compliance with this Agreement, any KOMATAC Acceptable Use Provisions (AUP), and applicable law, KOAMTAC will, commencing on the Start Date, permit CUSTOMER  to have access to and use KOAMTACON via the Admin Console.
2.2 Compliance with Laws.  In its performance of this Agreement, both parties agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of governmental authorities having jurisdiction.
2.3 No Additional Representations.  CUSTOMER shall not make any representations, warranties or guarantees concerning KOAMTACON and KOAMTAC services and shall refrain from making any false or misleading statements regarding the same.
2.4 Use of Subscriber Name and Logo; Press Releases.  Subscriber hereby grants KOAMTAC a non-exclusive right to use CUSTOMER'S  name and logo to identify CUSTOMER as a customer of KOAMTACON on or in connection with any KOAMTAC web site, promotional and marketing and securities materials.  Other than as provided above, KOAMTAC shall not identify or refer to CUSTOMER in any materials without CUSTOMER'S prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
2.5 Access to System.  Access to KOAMTACON by each CUSTOMER shall require the use of a password that will be automatically generated by KOAMTACON and may be changed by the CUSTOMER from time to time.  CUSTOMER is fully responsible and liable for all activities that occur under any such password issued to a CUSTOMER.  CUSTOMER agrees to notify KOAMTAC immediately of any unauthorized use of any CUSTOMER password or any other breach of security known to CUSTOMER.
2.6 Equipment.  CUSTOMER is solely responsible for providing and maintaining at its own expense all equipment, facilities and services necessary to access and use KOAMTACON, including, without limitation, computer hardware and software, modems, telephone service and Internet access.
2.7 Facilities and Services. KOAMTAC may process and store an Application and Customer Data in the United States or any other country in which KOAMTAC or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Services, CUSTOMER consents to this processing and storage of an Application and Customer Data. Under this Agreement, KOAMTAC is merely a data processor.
2.8     Disclosure for EU Customers. For any CUSTOMER electronically and/or physically based in the EU, note that KOAMTAC does not accept CUSTOMERS whose primary place of business, or access of KOAMTACON emanates from any country within the EU ("EU Customer(s)").  By agreeing to the terms herein and by using KOAMTCON services, you hereby warrant that you are not an EU Customer.  Should you later become an EU Customer while using KOAMTACON, you hereby agree to notify KOMATAC and discontinue use of KOAMTACON.  Failure to abide by the same shall be deemed a Breach as defined under Section 5.2 hereafter. 
2.9 Performance.  KOAMTAC will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that KOAMTACON is fully operational and accessible by CUSTOMER at least 90% of the time measured on a monthly basis, except for scheduled maintenance, and except for any loss or interruption of service due to causes beyond the reasonable control of KOAMTAC or that are not reasonably foreseeable by KOAMTAC, including, but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunications or digital transmission links and Internet slowdowns or failures.

3.2 Failure of Payment.  In addition to other remedies available to KOAMTAC, any payment not received by KOAMTAC when due will bear interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law from the date due until paid.  In addition, failure of CUSTOMER to pay any amounts due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of CUSTOMER’S access to KOAMTACON, and will be sufficient cause for termination of this Agreement.  Any such suspension does not relieve CUSTOMER from paying any past due amounts plus interest.

Section 4.  Customer Service
KOAMTAC will make e-mail and telephone customer support available to the Subscriber for KOAMTACON technical matters upon request according to commercially reasonable terms. Notwithstanding, CUSTOMER is responsible for technical support of Customer Data, and its Application(s) and Project(s).

In addition, KOAMTAC may terminate any, all, or any portion of the Services or Projects, if CUSTOMER meets any of the conditions in Sections 2.8, 5.2 and 5.3.

Subject to Section 7, KOAMTAC may discontinue any Services or any portion or feature for any reason at any time without liability to CUSTOMER. 
    5.5     Effect of Termination. If the Agreement is terminated, then: (i) the rights granted by one party to the other will immediately cease; (ii) all Fees (including Taxes) owed by CUSTOMER to KOAMTAC are immediately due upon receipt of the final bill; (iii) CUSTOMER will delete the Software and any Application; and (iv) upon request, each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to return or destroy all Confidential Information of the other party.

Subscriber acknowledges that KOAMTAC treats all KOAMTACON as KOAMTAC confidential information.  Subscriber agrees to conform to this treatment and to protect and preserve KOAMTACON from unauthorized use or disclosure.  Subscriber acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of KOAMTACON could cause irreparable harm to KOAMTAC for which monetary damages may be difficult to ascertain.  Subscriber agrees that KOAMTAC shall have the right, in addition to its other rights and remedies, to seek and obtain injunctive relief for or to prevent such unauthorized disclosure or uses, and/or to limit any improper benefits derived therefrom, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security.
6.2 Reservation.  KOAMTAC reserves any rights not expressly granted to CUSTOMER in this Agreement.  Any use of KOAMTACON not expressly authorized by this Agreement is strictly prohibited and will constitute a breach of this Agreement and infringement or misappropriation of KOAMTAC (and its suppliers’) intellectual property rights.
6.3 Subscriber Rights.  As between the parties, CUSTOMER will have and retain all title and ownership of, and intellectual property and other rights in and to, CUSTOMER'S own data.

    7.2     By KOAMTAC.  KOAMTAC will defend and indemnify CUSTOMER and its Affiliates against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the extent arising solely from an Allegation that use of (a) KOAMTAC technology used to provide the Services (excluding any open source software) or (b) any KOAMTAC Brand Feature infringes or misappropriates the third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, or trademark. 
    7.3     Exclusions. This Section 7 will not apply to the extent the underlying Allegation arises from:
    a. the indemnified party’s breach of this Agreement; 
    b. modifications to the indemnifying party’s technology by anyone other than the indemnifying party; 
    c. combination of the indemnifying party’s technology with materials not provided by the indemnifying party; or

If breach of this Section 7.4(a) prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the indemnifying party’s obligations under Section 7.1 or 7.2 (as applicable) will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice. 
    b. The indemnified party tenders sole control of the indemnified portion of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (i) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (ii) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 
    7.5     Remedies.
    a. If KOAMTAC reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, then KOAMTAC may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure the right for CUSTOMER to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative. 
    b. If KOAMTAC does not believe the remedies in Section 7.5(a) are commercially reasonable, then KOAMTAC may suspend or terminate CUSTOMER’S use of the impacted Services. 
    7.6     Sole Rights and Obligations. Without affecting either party’s termination rights, this Section 7 states the parties’ only rights and obligations under this Agreement for intellectual property rights-related allegations and Third-Party Legal Proceedings.
